# Improvement Suggestions

## Codebase

1. **Centralized State Management**

   - Move data management from the `Dashboard` component to a centralized store (e.g., Redux, Context API) for easier scaling and consistency.

2. **Use Constants**

   - Replace hardcoded strings with reusable constants for better maintainability and fewer errors.

3. **Modular API Calls**
   - Move API logic to dedicated service files or custom hooks to improve reusability and cleaner components.

## Roles & Permissions

4. **Better Permissions**
   - Add fine-grained permissions (e.g., `canEdit`, `canView`) for more flexibility in managing user/admin actions.

## Components

5. **More Flexible Props**

   - Add customizable props like `height`, `width`, and `styles` to common components (`Switch`, `Modal`) for better adaptability.

6. **Improve Reusability**
   - Refactor components to support more use cases and provide sensible defaults with optional overrides.
